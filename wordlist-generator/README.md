# Custom Wordlist Generator
A python script to create a custom target based wordlist.

# Introduction
As you Know that when you perform a Brute-Force attack you need to have wordlist that has multiple passwords. Most of the wordlist available in the internet is made up of random possible passwords. But think of a situation where you need to exploit a person whose password is related to his pet's name like Schmuserkadser(Famous meme of the crying cat). In that situation, there is a very less chance that you are gonna find a wordlist containing the specific pet's name. So this program will help you to solve this task!
